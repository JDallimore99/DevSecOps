# Static Analysis using Bandit

## Download the source code
We will do all the exercises locally first in DevSecOps-Box, so let’s start the exercise.

First, we need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.
```
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp
cd webapp
```
# Install Bandit
```
pip3 install bandit==1.7.4
```
We have successfully installed Bandit scanner. Let’s explore the functionality it provides us.
```
bandit --help

Bandit - a Python source code security analyzer

positional arguments:
  targets               source file(s) or directory(s) to be tested

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r, --recursive       find and process files in subdirectories
  -a {file,vuln}, --aggregate {file,vuln}
                        aggregate output by vulnerability (default) or by filename
  -n CONTEXT_LINES, --number CONTEXT_LINES
                        maximum number of code lines to output for each issue
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --configfile CONFIG_FILE
                        optional config file to use for selecting plugins and overriding defaults
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        profile to use (defaults to executing all tests)
  -t TESTS, --tests TESTS
                        comma-separated list of test IDs to run
  -s SKIPS, --skip SKIPS
                        comma-separated list of test IDs to skip
  -l, --level           report only issues of a given severity level or higher (-l for LOW, -ll for MEDIUM, -lll for
                        HIGH)
  --severity-level {all,low,medium,high}
                        report only issues of a given severity level or higher. "all" and "low" are likely to produce
                        the same results, but it is possible for rules to be undefined which will not be listed in
                        "low".
  -i, --confidence      report only issues of a given confidence level or higher (-i for LOW, -ii for MEDIUM, -iii for
                        HIGH)
  --confidence-level {all,low,medium,high}
                        report only issues of a given confidence level or higher. "all" and "low" are likely to
                        produce the same results, but it is possible for rules to be undefined which will not be
                        listed in "low".
  -f {csv,custom,html,json,screen,txt,xml,yaml}, --format {csv,custom,html,json,screen,txt,xml,yaml}
                        specify output format
  --msg-template MSG_TEMPLATE
                        specify output message template (only usable with --format custom), see CUSTOM FORMAT section
                        for list of available values
  -o [OUTPUT_FILE], --output [OUTPUT_FILE]
                        write report to filename
  -v, --verbose         output extra information like excluded and included files
  -d, --debug           turn on debug mode
  -q, --quiet, --silent
                        only show output in the case of an error
  --ignore-nosec        do not skip lines with # nosec comments
  -x EXCLUDED_PATHS, --exclude EXCLUDED_PATHS
                        comma-separated list of paths (glob patterns supported) to exclude from scan (note that these
                        are in addition to the excluded paths provided in the config file) (default:
                        .svn,CVS,.bzr,.hg,.git,__pycache__,.tox,.eggs,*.egg)
  -b BASELINE, --baseline BASELINE
                        path of a baseline report to compare against (only JSON-formatted files are accepted)
  --ini INI_PATH        path to a .bandit file that supplies command line arguments
  --exit-zero           exit with 0, even with results found
  --version             show program's version number and exit

...[SNIP]...
```
# Run the scanner
As we have learned in the DevSecOps Gospel, we would like to store the tool results in a JSON file. We are using the tee command here to show the output and store it in a file simultaneously.
```
bandit -r . -f json | tee bandit-output.json
```
Bandit ran successfully, and it found three security issues.
1. One high severity issue
2. One medium severity issue
3. One low severity issue
In the next exercise, we will explore how to Embed Bandit to the CI/CD pipeline.
