# Secrets Scanning with TruffleHog
In this scenario, you will learn how to install and run truffleHog. Trufflehog helps you in finding secrets committed in a git repository.

To achieve the above objectives, you will need to do the following:

1. Clone/download the source code
2. Install the secret scanning tool
3. Run the secret scanner on the code

## Download the Source Code
First, we need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.
```
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp
cd webapp
**Output**
Cloning into 'webapp'...

Receiving objects: 100% (228/228), 1.03 MiB | 1.04 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (86/86), done.
```
## Install TruffleHog
Let’s install the TruffleHog tool on the system to scan for the secrets in our code.
```
pip3 install trufflehog==2.2.1

Let's explore what TruffleHog provides us
```
trufflehog --help
**Output**
usage: trufflehog [-h] [--json] [--regex] [--rules RULES] [--allow ALLOW]
                  [--entropy DO_ENTROPY] [--since_commit SINCE_COMMIT]
                  [--max_depth MAX_DEPTH] [--branch BRANCH]
                  [-i INCLUDE_PATHS_FILE] [-x EXCLUDE_PATHS_FILE]
                  [--repo_path REPO_PATH] [--cleanup]
                  git_url

Find secrets hidden in the depths of git.

positional arguments:
  git_url               URL for secret searching

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --json                Output in JSON
  --regex               Enable high signal regex checks
  --rules RULES         Ignore default regexes and source from json file
  --allow ALLOW         Explicitly allow regexes from json list file
  --entropy DO_ENTROPY  Enable entropy checks
  --since_commit SINCE_COMMIT
                        Only scan from a given commit hash
  --max_depth MAX_DEPTH
                        The max commit depth to go back when searching for
                        secrets
  --branch BRANCH       Name of the branch to be scanned
  -i INCLUDE_PATHS_FILE, --include_paths INCLUDE_PATHS_FILE
                        File with regular expressions (one per line), at least
                        one of which must match a Git object path in order for
                        it to be scanned; lines starting with "#" are treated
                        as comments and are ignored. If empty or not provided
                        (default), all Git object paths are included unless
                        otherwise excluded via the --exclude_paths option.
  -x EXCLUDE_PATHS_FILE, --exclude_paths EXCLUDE_PATHS_FILE
                        File with regular expressions (one per line), none of
                        which may match a Git object path in order for it to
                        be scanned; lines starting with "#" are treated as
                        comments and are ignored. If empty or not provided
                        (default), no Git object paths are excluded unless
                        effectively excluded via the --include_paths option.
  --repo_path REPO_PATH
                        Path to the cloned repo. If provided, git_url will not
                        be used
  --cleanup             Clean up all temporary result files
```

## Run the scanner
We are using the tee command here to show the output and store it in a file simultaneously.
- --json: tells that output should be in the JSON format
```
trufflehog --json . | tee secret.json

Got some results from the tool but are these false positives or real issues.
