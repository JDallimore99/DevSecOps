# How to Embed Bandit into GitLab

## Simple CI/CD Pipeline
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```

## Allow the job failure
We do not want to fail the builds/jobs/scan in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2, as security tools spit a significant amount of false positives.
You can use the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found issues.
The pipeline should look like this
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       
   - source env/bin/activate              
   - pip install -r requirements.txt   
   - python manage.py check               

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

sast:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/bandit  
    - docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/src --rm hysnsec/bandit -r /src -f json -o /src/bandit-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [bandit-output.json]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true 
```
You will notice that the sast job failed however it didnâ€™t block others from continuing further.
> Note: The above option mounts the current directory in the host (runner) to /src inside the container. This could also be -v /home/ubuntu/code:/src or c:\users\code:/src if you were using windows.
Instead of manually removing the container after the scan, we can use --rm option so docker can clean up after itself.
What is this --user option here, and why are we using it? Can you please try removing this option --user $(id -u):$(id -g) and see what would happen?
