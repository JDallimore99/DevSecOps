# How to Embed Trufflehog into GitLabs

## Create Pipeline
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager
```
## Embed TruffleHog in CI/CD pipeline
As discussed in the Secrets Scanning exercise, we can embed TruffleHog in our CI/CD pipeline. However, do remember you need to run the command manually before you embed this SAST tool in the pipeline.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

git-secrets:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/trufflehog
    - docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/src --rm hysnsec/trufflehog file:///src
```
As discussed, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline.
Let’s try running the git status command after the Trufflehog command and see the job’s output.
```
git-secrets:
  stage: build
  script:
    - apk add git
    - docker pull hysnsec/trufflehog
    - docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v $(pwd):/src --rm hysnsec/trufflehog file:///src
    - git status
```
The --user $(id -u):$(id - g) denotes use of thr current user as a good security practice.
Notice the last line of the above job, we have added git status command.
```
HEAD detached at c4560d9
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
The output tells us that HEAD is detached; what does it mean? It means we’re not on a branch but checked out a specific commit in the history. Trufflehog needs us to be on a branch. Hence Trufflehog didn’t find any secrets, and we can fix it with the following jobs.
To solve this we can use the repo_path option provided by Trufflehog.
If we use repo_path there is no need to tell truffleHog to use the specific branch as it can access branch cloned by Gitlab CI
```
git-secrets:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker run -v $(pwd):/src --rm hysnsec/trufflehog --repo_path /src file:///src --json | tee trufflehog-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [trufflehog-output.json]
    when: always  # What is this for?
    expire_in: one week
```
## Allow the job failure
 We do not want to fail the builds/jobs/scan in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2, as security tools spit a significant amount of false positives.
You can use the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found issues.
```
git-secrets:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker run -v $(pwd):/src --rm hysnsec/trufflehog --repo_path /src file:///src --json | tee trufflehog-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [trufflehog-output.json]
    when: always  
    expire_in: one week
  allow_failure: true 
```
After adding the allow_failure tag, the pipeline would look like the following.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

git-secrets:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker run -v $(pwd):/src --rm hysnsec/trufflehog --repo_path /src file:///src --json | tee trufflehog-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [trufflehog-output.json]
    when: always  
    expire_in: one week
  allow_failure: true
```
You will notice that the git-secrets job failed however it didn’t block others from continuing further.
