# How to Embed Gosec into GitLab
In this scenario, you will learn how to embed GoSec in the CI/CD pipeline.
You will learn to use gosec in CI/CD pipeline and how to allow job failure when the tool found several issues.
# A simple CI/CD pipeline
Download the code using git clone in DevSecOps Box.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/golang.git golang
cd golang
```
Rename git url to the new one.
```sh
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/golang.git
```
Then, push the code into the repository and it will automatically create a new project if not exist.
```sh
git push -u origin --all
```
And enter the GitLab credentials.
```sh
Username for 'http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training': root
Password for 'http://root@gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training': pdso-training
```
Created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is a build step"

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
We have four jobs in this pipeline, a build job, a test job, a integration job and a prod job.
## Embed Gosec in CI/CD pipeline
As discussed in the Static Analysis using Gosec exercise, we can embed Gosec in our CI/CD pipeline. However, do remember you need to run the command manually before you embed this SAST tool in the pipeline.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is a build step"

sast:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src securego/gosec -fmt json -out gosec-output.json ./...
  artifacts:
    paths: [gosec-output.json]
    when: always

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
As discussed, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline.
```
You will notice that the sast job’s output is saved in gosec-output.json file.
## Allow the job failure
We do not want to fail the builds/jobs/scan in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2, as security tools spit a significant amount of false positives.

You can use the allow_failure tag to “not fail the build” even though the tool found issues.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

sast:
  stage: build
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src securego/gosec -fmt json -out gosec-output.json ./...
  artifacts:
    paths: [gosec-output.json]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
 ```
