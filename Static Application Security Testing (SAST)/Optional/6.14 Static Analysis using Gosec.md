# Static Analysis using Gosec
In this scenario, you will learn how to run gosec scan on Golang code.
Download the code, install the SAST tool called gosec and then finally run the SAST scan on the code.
## Download the source code
Download the source code of the project from our git repository.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/golang.git webapp
```
Letâ€™s cd into the application so we can scan the app.
```sh
cd webapp
```
We are now in the webapp directory.
## Install gosec
GoSec inspects source code for security problems by scanning the Go AST, also can be configured to only run a subset of rules, to exclude certain file paths, and produce reports in different formats
You can find more details about the project at https://github.com/securego/gosec

Need to install it with the following command.
```sh
curl -s https://dl.google.com/go/go1.17.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /usr/local
```
Need to configure GOROOT, GOPATH and PATH variables so golang can find binaries and third party libraries.
```sh
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
```
Install gosec on the system to perform static analysis.
```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/securego/gosec/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v2.4.0
**Output**
securego/gosec info checking GitHub for tag 'v2.4.0'
securego/gosec info found version: 2.4.0 for v2.4.0/linux/amd64
securego/gosec info installed /root/go/bin/gosec
```
Running curl and piping it to a shell is a security issue. how could we improve it?
You guessed it right. Use native tools to install it. For e.g., go get.
```sh
go get -u github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec

go get: installing executables with 'go get' in module mode is deprecated.
        Use 'go install pkg@version' instead.
        For more information, see https://golang.org/doc/go-get-install-deprecation
        or run 'go help get' or 'go help install'.
```

gosec - Golang security checker

gosec analyzes Go source code to look for common programming mistakes that
can lead to security problems.
