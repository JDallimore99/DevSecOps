# How to Fix The Issues Reported by Semgrep
Learn how to fix issues reported by the semgrep tool in Django source code.
You will do the following in this activity.
1. Download the source code from the git repository.
2. Install the Semgrep tool.
3. Run the SAST scan on the code.
4. Fix the issues found by Semgrep.

## Download the source code
Need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/dvpa webapp
```
**Output**
```sh

Lets cd into the application so we can scan the app.
```sh
cd webapp
```
We are now in the webapp directory.
## Install Semgrep
Semgrep is a fast, open-source, static analysis tool that excels at expressing code standards — without complicated queries — and surfacing bugs early in the development flow. Precise rules look like the code you’re searching; no more traversing abstract syntax trees or wrestling with regexes.
You can find more details about the project at https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep.
Install the Semgrep tool on the system to perform static analysis.
```sh
pip3 install semgrep==0.108.0

  Run `semgrep SUBCOMMAND --help` for more information on each subcommand

  If no subcommand is passed, will run `scan` subcommand by default

 ```
 ## Run the scanner
Before we run semgrep, we need to create the rules file, semgrep_rules.yaml. These rules will help us find vulnerabilities in the code. You can use any text editor to create this file with the following content.
```sh
rules:
- id: avoid-pyyaml-load
  metadata:
    owasp: 'A8: Insecure Deserialization'
    cwe: 'CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data'
    references:
    - https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/wiki/PyYAML-yaml.load(input)-Deprecation
    - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18342
  languages:
  - python
  message: |
    Avoid using `load()`. `PyYAML.load` can create arbitrary Python
    objects. A malicious actor could exploit this to run arbitrary
    code. Use `safe_load()` instead.

    references:

    Possible SQL Injection
  severity: WARNING
  patterns:
  - pattern: $X.execute(...)
  - pattern-not: $X.execute(..., [...])
  - pattern-not: $X.execute("...")
```
In the above file, we have created rules to find Insecure Deserialization and SQL Injection attacks. Let’s run the Semgrep tool against the current working directory.
```sh
semgrep -f semgrep_rules.yaml .
```
**Output
```sh

```
We got 6 findings, one insecure deserialization, and five SQL Injections. We must fix all of these issues to keep this app secure.
## Fixing Insecure Deserialization
Python yaml library has a known vulnerability around YAML deserialization. We can search for this known security issue on the CVE website. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=python%20yaml
For more details, please visit CVE-2020-1747. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1747 As mentioned before, our code is vulnerable to Deserialization Attacks https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html.

If you recall, one of the findings in the previous step was unsafe YAML load, and the following was the code snippet for the same.
```sh
  blog/dashboard/post.py 
     avoid-pyyaml-load
        Avoid using `load()`. `PyYAML.load` can create arbitrary Python objects. A malicious actor
        could exploit this to run arbitrary code. Use `safe_load()` instead.

         ▶▶┆ Autofix ▶ yaml.safe_load(import_data)
        204┆ import_post_data = yaml.load(import_data)
          ⋮┆----------------------------------------
     possible-sqli
        Possible SQL Injection

         60┆ cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM posts WHERE slug='{slug}'")
```
Lets verify this issue exists by opening up the blog/dashboard/post.py file using any text editor like vim or nano. Ensure the security issue exists at line 204 and the program uses the insecure yaml.load function. To fix this issue, we need to replace yaml.load with a safe alternative yaml.safe_load.
Let’s run the semgrep scanner once again
```
semgrep -f semgrep_rules.yaml .
```
**Output**
```

```
As you can see, there is no yaml.load issue in the output. The total issue count has decreased from 6 to 5.
## Fixing SQL Injection Issue
Apart from Insecure Deserializatio issue, there were five possible SQL Injection issues as well. We can fix these issues in various ways, but the best way to fix SQL Injection issues is Parameterized queries, also known as Parameter Binding.
```sh
Findings:

  blog/auth.py 
     possible-sqli
        Possible SQL Injection

         14┆ cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='{username}' AND password='{hashsed_password}'")


  blog/dashboard/post.py 
     possible-sqli
        Possible SQL Injection

         60┆ cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM posts WHERE slug='{slug}'")


  blog/user.py 
     possible-sqli
        Possible SQL Injection

         57┆ cur.execute(
         58┆     f"INSERT INTO users (`email`, `full_name`, `password`) VALUES ('{email}', '{full_name}', '{hashed_password}')")


  blog/views.py 
     possible-sqli
        Possible SQL Injection

         37┆ cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM posts WHERE slug='{slug}'")
          ⋮┆----------------------------------------
         68┆ cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE '%{query}%'")
```
First, we will try to fix the SQL Injection issue present in the blog/auth.py file at line number 14. As you can see in the following code snippet, there is a SQL injection issue in the check_auth function.
```
def check_auth(username, password):
   """ This function is called to check if a username / password
       combination is valid.
   """
   cur = db.connection.cursor()
   hashsed_password = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
   cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='{username}' AND password='{hashsed_password}'")
   user = cur.fetchone()

   if user is None:
      return False

   session["is_logged_in"] = True
   session["id"] = user.get("id")
   session["email"] = user.get("email")
   session["full_name"] = user.get("full_name")

   return user
```
The cur.execute function call will execute the SQL query on the database. It takes the username and password as possible inputs to the SQL query.

You can also verify this behavior dynamically by reproducing SQL query errors.

> Note Learn more about SQL Injection here.

You can replace line number 14 with the following code. This code will fix the SQL Injection issue.
```
cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=%s AND password=%s", [username, hashsed_password ])
```
Then, rerun the scanner
```sh
semgrep -f semgrep_rules.yaml .
