# Docker Netowrking

## Bridge
Docker has several Network drivers that we can use when creating the containers, including the following.
|Network|Description|
|:-----|:----------|
|BRIDGE|This is the default network driver when you don’t specify a driver for the containers. Containers on the same bridged network can speak to each other, but are isolated from containers on other bridged networks. All containers can access the external network through NAT|
|HOST|The containers use the host’s networking directly, while retaining separation on storage and processing. Ports exposed by the container are exposed on the external network using the host’s IP address|
|MACVLAN|When creating a macvlan, you assign a parent network device (e.g. “eth0”). Each container on the macvlan network will receive its own MAC address on the network that eth0 is connected to. Each container has full network access. Warning: when misconfigured, you may overrun the network with too many MACs, or you may duplicate IP addresses|
|NONE|networking is disabled with this network driver, containers cannot communicate to each other, nor with the external network|
Next, we will explore networking in docker with provided command called docker network.
```SH
Usage:  docker network COMMAND

Manage networks

Commands:
  connect     Connect a container to a network
  create      Create a network
  disconnect  Disconnect a container from a network
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more networks
  ls          List networks
  prune       Remove all unused networks
  rm          Remove one or more networks

Run 'docker network COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```
To see the available networks, we can use these commands
```sh
docker network ls
or
docker network list
**Output**
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
a49ba9341007        bridge              bridge              local
d12b019b2364        host                host                local
ddc639acd513        none                null                local
```
There are three networks created when we install docker. We can create a new network with the following command.
```sh
docker network create mynetwork
**Output**
4e2338e543280718087375b475bfe73de1e6019ad94b4c408a73dad3ccbe78ff
```
We can verify the network creation process by using the following command.
```
docker network ls
**Output**
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
8b2369f350d5        bridge              bridge              local
019ff813f4f4        host                host                local
4e2338e54328        mynetwork           bridge              local
a9e2bdd51902        none                null                local
```
We can also explore more details about the network using **docker inspect** command. As you can see, we can ascertain the subnet and the gateway assigned to the network as well.
```sh
docker inspect mynetwork
**Output**

```
We can attach the network to any container with the following command.
```sh 
docker run -d --name ubuntu --network mynetwork -it ubuntu:18.04
```
We can verify the network details using the docker inspect command.
```sh
docker inspect mynetwork

        },
        "Options": {},
        "Labels": {}

]
```
We can test the network connectivity in the container by executing apt update command. If the below command works, then the container is able to reach external world, including the DNS server.

```sh
docker exec ubuntu apt update

```
We are able to update the apt cache so we do have network connectivity to the internet.
Lets clean up by removing the container and the network we created before.
```sh
docker rm -f ubuntu
docker network rm mynetwork
```

## macvlan
We can create macvlan network by using the following command.
```sh
docker network create --driver macvlan mymacvlan
**Output**
8df059075f385271a681a5ddc78b6f137607117aa0a5ac1cd22159c599d804c8
```
Check if network is created
```sh
docker network list
**Output**

188042442f13        none                null                local
```
If we run ifconfig, we will see there is an interface with the name dm-8df059075f38. The network interface name in this case is dm-8df059075f38, it might be different in your case, however it would start with dm-.
```sh

```
We can attach the new network to a container with the following command.
```sh
docker run -d --name ubuntu --network mymacvlan -it ubuntu:18.04
```
Cross check with network information with docker inspect
```sh
docker inspect ubuntu -f "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks }}" | jq
**Output**
{
  "mymacvlan": {
    "IPAMConfig": null,
    "Links": null,
    "Aliases": [
      "2a42eb64e5ac"
    ],

    "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
    "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:12:00:02",
    "DriverOpts": null
  }
}
```
Next, we will clean up the changes we made by removing the container and network we created.
```sh
docker rm -f ubuntu
docker network rm mymacvlan
```

## none
This network disables/isolates the network in the container(s).
```sh
docker run -d --name ubuntu --network=none -it ubuntu:18.04
**Output**
76f1219d23bec228e3d3c3320cfeed79eb7010865664f4fd8c55df55cc58660c
```
We can explore the network information with the docker inspect command.
```sh
docker inspect ubuntu -f "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks }}" | jq
**Ouput**

  "none": {
    "IPAMConfig": null,
    "Links": null,

    "GlobalIPv6Address": "",
    "GlobalIPv6PrefixLen": 0,
    "MacAddress": "",
    "DriverOpts": null
  }
}
```
We can test the network connectivity in the container by executing apt update command. If the below command works, then the container is able to reach external world, including the DNS server.
```sh

As we can see, it failed to update the packages, it doesn’t have access to the internet.


## Challenge
**Create a network with bridge driver called app and define 172.10.2.0/16 as a subnet**
```sh
docker network create app --subnet "172.10.2.0/16"
```
**Run the container with ubuntu:18.04 image in the background and give it the name myubuntu**
To run a container in the background -d option of docker run is used.
However, just with -d the container would exit right after creation. In order to keep the ubuntu container running in the background, let’s use a combination of -it option along with the -d option.
```sh
docker run -d -it --name myubuntu ubuntu:18.04
```
**Attach app network to the myubuntu container**
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_connect
```sh
docker network connect app myubuntu
```
**What would happen if we remove the network driver without killing the container?**
```sh
docker network rm app
```
There is an error removing the network due to the network having active endpoints
