## Download the source code
We will do all the exercises locally first in DevSecOps-Box, so let’s start the exercise.
First, We need to download the source code of the project from our git repository.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv webapp
**Output**
Cloning into 'webapp'...
warning: redirecting to https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/django.nv.git/
remote: Enumerating objects: 228, done.
remote: Total 228 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 228
Receiving objects: 100% (228/228), 1.03 MiB | 1.04 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (86/86), done.
```
Lets cd into the application code so we can scan the app.
```sh
cd webapp
```
We are now in the webapp directory.
## Install RetireJS
There are lots of JavaScript libraries for use on the Web and in Node.JS apps. The availability of these libraries greatly simplifies development, but also increases the security risks. Because of rampant abuse of these libraries, attackers are concentrating on these libraries. Realizing the need for awareness, OWASP has included “Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities” as part of the OWASP Top 10 list.
RetireJS helps you in finding the insecure Javascript libraries in your code.
Source: https://github.com/retirejs/retire.js
First, we need to install Node JS and NPM.
```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash -
apt install nodejs -y
```
Then we can install the Retire.js tool on the system to find the insecure Javascript libraries.
```sh
npm install -g retire@3.0.6
**Output**
/usr/bin/retire -> /usr/lib/node_modules/retire/bin/retire
+ retire@3.0.6
added 44 packages from 39 contributors in 4.276s
```
Let’s explore what options retirejs gives us.
```sh
retire --help
**Output**
  Usage: retire [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help               output usage information
    -V, --version            output the version number

    -p, --package            limit node scan to packages where parent is mentioned in package.json (ignore node_modules)
    -n, --node               Run node dependency scan only
    -j, --js                 Run scan of JavaScript files only
    -v, --verbose            Show identified files (by default only vulnerable files are shown)
    -x, --dropexternal       Don't include project provided vulnerability repository
    -c, --nocache            Don't use local cache

    --jspath <path>          Folder to scan for javascript files
    --nodepath <path>        Folder to scan for node files
    --path <path>            Folder to scan for both
    --jsrepo <path|url>      Local or internal version of repo
    --noderepo <path|url>    Local or internal version of repo
    --cachedir <path>        Path to use for local cache instead of /tmp/.retire-cache
    --proxy <url>            Proxy url (http://some.sever:8080)
    --outputformat <format>  Valid formats: text, json, jsonsimple, depcheck (experimental) and cyclonedx
    --outputpath <path>      File to which output should be written
    --ignore <paths>         Comma delimited list of paths to ignore
    --ignorefile <path>      Custom ignore file, defaults to .retireignore / .retireignore.json
    --severity <level>       Specify the bug severity level from which the process fails. Allowed levels none, low, medium, high, critical. Default: none
    --exitwith <code>        Custom exit code (default: 13) when vulnerabilities are found
    --colors                 Enable color output (console output only)
    --insecure               Enable fetching remote jsrepo/noderepo files from hosts using an insecure or self-signed SSL (TLS) certificate
    --cacert <path>          Use the specified certificate file to verify
```
## Run the Scanner
Front end dependencies managed via npm are stored in the package.json file. Let’s explore the contents of the package.json file.
```sh
cat package.json
**Output**

As we can see, we are using various javascript libraries in this project. Let’s find if we are using any vulnerable libraries.
```sh
retire --outputformat json --outputpath retire_output.json
**Output**
DEPRECATION NOTICE: The node scanning is depreacated and will be removed soon. See https://github.com/RetireJS/retire.js/wiki/Deprecating-the-node.js-scanner

ERROR: Could not find dependencies: bcrypt-nodejs, body-parser, consolidate, csurf, dont-sniff-mimetype, express, express-session, forever, helmet, marked, m
ongodb, node-esapi, serve-favicon, swig, underscore. You may need to run npm install
```
As we have learned in the DevSecOps Gospel, we should always try to save the tool’s output in a machine-readable format. This output will enable us to parse it via script(s).
- --outputpath : flag specifies the output file path.
- --outputformat : flag specifies that output format. Here it’s the JSON format.
You will notice we need to install the npm packages available in the package.json file using the npm install command before running the scan.
```sh
npm install
**Output**
npm WARN deprecated bcrypt-nodejs@0.0.3: bcrypt-nodejs is no longer actively maintained. Please use bcrypt or bcryptjs. See https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js/wiki/bcrypt-vs-brypt.js to learn more about these two options
npm WARN deprecated swig@1.4.2: This package is no longer maintained

```
Oh no, we have a big issue list to work on.
Let’s move to the next step.
## Challenge
In this exercise, you will explore and use the advanced features of RetireJS.
**Configure retirejs such that it only throws non zero exit code when high severity issues are present in the results**
Use severity argument when running retirejs
```sh
retire --severity high --outputformat json --outputpath retire_output.json
```
Confused why retire_output.json has medium and low severity issues? Then you need to re-read what the --severity flag does in retirejs. Its not a bug but a functionality.
Please note that an exit code is not always 1 even though the tool found security issues. It can be any number pre-defined by the developer of the tool.
Since every developer/organization is different so are the exit codes. We only care if its zero or non-zero. For example, if you noticed, the argument that we used to filter severity would return exit code 13.

**Mark all high severity issues as False Positive and save the output in JSON format at location /webapp/retire_output.json**
RetireJS allows us to mark an issue or issues as False Positive (FP) using .retireignore.json file.
.retireignore.json file needs to be created first using commands such as touch .retireignore.json or with a vi editor.
1) Create /webapp/.retireignore.json
```sh
cat > /webapp/.retireignore.json
[
    {
        "component": "qs",
        "version": "0.6.6",
        "justification" : "False Positive"
    },
    {
        "component": "tough-cookie",
        "version": "2.2.2",
        "justification" : "False Positive"
    },
    {
        "component": "handlebars",
        "version": "4.0.5",
        "justification" : "False Positive"
    },
    {
        "component": "growl",
        "version": "1.9.2",
        "justification" : "False Positive"
    },
    {
        "component": "adm-zip",
        "version": "0.4.4",
        "justification" : "False Positive"
    },
    {
        "component":"dojo",
        "version":"1.4.2",
        "justification" : "False Positive"
    },
    {
        "component":"extend",
        "version":"3.0.0",
        "justification" : "False Positive"
    }
]
```
Press control + d to exit write mode
2) Once we mark an issue as FP, we need to use the following command while scanning to avoid showing these issues in the subsequent scans.
```sh
retire --severity high --ignorefile .retireignore.json --outputformat json --outputpath retire_output.json
```
More information about the ignore feature is available here.
