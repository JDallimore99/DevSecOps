# How to Embed RetireJS into GitLab
## CI/CD Pipeline
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build

  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

```
## Challenge
**Embed Retire.js in the test stage with job named oast-frontend. You can make use of any container image of your choice, including the node image.**
```
oast-frontend:
  stage: test
  image: node:alpine3.10
  script:
    - npm install             # Install the dependencies before scans
    - npm install -g retire   # Install retirejs tool
    - retire --outputformat json --outputpath retirejs-report.json --severity high
```
**Save the output as JSON format with name retirejs-report.json and upload it using artifacts attribute**
```
oast-frontend:
  stage: test
  image: node:alpine3.10
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm install -g retire
    - retire --outputformat json --outputpath retirejs-report.json --severity high
  artifacts:
    paths: [retirejs-report.json]
    when: always
    expire_in: one week # Optional
```
## Embed RetireJS in CI/CD pipeline
As discussed in the SCA using the Retire.js exercise, we can embed the RetireJS tool in our CI/CD pipeline. However, do remember you need to run the command manually before you embed OAST in the pipeline.
Maybe you want to scan the components before performing SAST scans.

> Did you notice the job failed because of non zero exit code(exit 13)?
Why did the job fail? Because the tool found security issues. This is the expected behavior of any DevSecOps friendly tool.
You need to either fix the security issues or add allow_failure: true to let the job finish without blocking other jobs.
Please refer to the Linux Exit Code exercise in Linux Basics chapter.

You will notice that the oast-frontend job stores the output to a file retirejs-report.json. This is done to ensure we can process the results further via APIs or vulnerability management systems like DefectDojo

## Allow the job failure
You do not want to fail the builds in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2. If a security tool fails a build upon security findings, you would want to allow it to fail and not block the pipeline as there would be false positives in the results.
You can use the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found security issues.

You will notice that the oast-frontend job has failed but didnâ€™t block the other jobs from running.
