# Software Component Analysis using bundler-audit (Ruby)
Learn how to install bundler audit and run OAST/SCA Scans on a ruby on rails repository.
Need to download the code, install the OAST/SCA tool, and then finally run the OAST scan on the code.

## Download the source code
Download the source code of the project from the git repository
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/rails.git webapp
```
cd into the application so we can scan the app
```
cd webapp

## Install bundler-audit 
We need to install Ruby using rbenv utility so lets install rbenv
```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash

All done!
Note that this installer does NOT edit your shell configuration files:
1. You'll want to ensure that `~/.rbenv/bin' is added to PATH.
2. Run `rbenv init' to view instructions on how to configure rbenv for your shell.
3. Launch a new terminal window after editing shell configuration files.
4. (Optional) Run the doctor command to verify the installation:
   wget -q "https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-doctor" -O- | bash
```
We need to use ruby "2.6.5", therefore we need to install it using rbenv
```sh
rbenv install 2.6.5

Need to install a compiler ( compiler is something that eventually produces machine code from Ruby code, whether that's ahead-of-time or just-in-time.), first update apt
```sh
apt update
``` 
Then install the essential compiler for Ruby
```sh
apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev -y
**Output**

Try Installing Ruby again
```sh
rbenv install --verbose 2.6.5
```
We need to ruby on the path
```sh
export PATH="/root/.rbenv/versions/2.6.5/bin:$PATH"
```
Can now verify the ruby version using the following command
```sh
ruby --version
**Output**
ruby 2.6.5p114 (2019-10-01 revision 67812) [x86_64-linux]
```
Install the bundler-audit tool to perform SCA
```sh
gem install --user-install bundler-audit
