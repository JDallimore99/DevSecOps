# How to Embed AuditJS into GitLab
## A Simple CI/CD pipeline
Let’s download the code using git clone in DevSecOps Box.
```sj
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/nodejs.git nodejs
cd nodejs
```
Rename git url to the new one.
```sh
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/nodejs.git
```
Then, push the code into the repository.
```sh
git push -u origin --all
```
And enter the GitLab credentials.
```sh
Username for 'http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training': root
Password for 'http://root@gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training':
```
Next, considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.
```sh
image: node:latest

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is an test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step"
```
Log into GitLab using the following details and run the above pipeline.
Embed AuditJS in CI/CD pipeline
Embed the AuditJS tool in our CI/CD pipeline. However, do remember you need to run the command manually before you embed OAST in the pipeline
```sh
image: node:latest

cache:
  paths:
  - node_modules/

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is an test step"

auditjs:
  image: docker:dind
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src hysnsec/auditjs ossi -q -j | tee auditjs-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [auditjs-output.json]
    when: always # What is this for?
    expire_in: one week

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step"
```
Copy the above CI script and add it to the .gitlab.ci.yml file on Gitlab repo at https://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/nodejs/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml.
## Allow the job failure
You do not want to fail the builds in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2. If a security tool fails a build upon security findings, you would want to allow it to fail and not block the pipeline as there would be false positives in the results.
You can use the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found security issues.
```sh
image: node:latest

cache:
  paths:
  - node_modules/

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install

auditjs:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src hysnsec/auditjs ossi -q -j | tee auditjs-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [auditjs-output.json]
    when: always # What is this for?
    expire_in: one week
  allow_failure: true  #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
```
You will notice that the auditjs job has failed but didn’t block the other jobs from running.
