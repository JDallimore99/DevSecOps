```
## Run the scanner
We are using --json argument to output the results in JSON format.
```sh
snyk test --json .
```
We are greeted with an error. Snyk is complaining about missing API Token as it’s a paid solution and wants you to register before it can run the scan.
If you haven’t registered before, you can go to Snyk website and click SIGN UP FOR FREE -> Select Google account options -> Complete sign up -> Select CLI and go to the account settings page https://app.snyk.io/account and copy the token.
Once you have the token, you can authenticate to the Snyk service using the snyk auth command.
```sh
snyk auth cc4e3792-fe51-4d30-bb6f-0019f7513ab6
**Output**
Your account has been authenticated. Snyk is now ready to be used
```
Now that we are authenticated, we can now scan our code with the snyk test command.
```sh
snyk test --json .
```
But it raises another error; we need to install the dependencies using npm install.
```sh
npm install
```
It looks like we do not have npm installed. Install it using the following commands.
```sh
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash -
apt install nodejs -y
npm install
```
Re-run the scan and save the output in a file.
```sh
snyk test --json . > output.json
```
If you want to get the dashboard on the Snyk website, then monitor for new vulnerabilities, please use the following command:
```sh
snyk monitor
```
