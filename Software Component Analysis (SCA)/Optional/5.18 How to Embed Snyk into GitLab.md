# How to Embed Snyk into GitLab
You will learn to use Snyk in CI/CD pipeline and allow the job to fail even when the tool found several issues.
## Considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager
```
Log into GitLab using the following details and run the above pipeline.  
Need to create a CI/CD pipeline by replacing the .gitlab-ci.yml file content with the above CI script. Click on the Edit button to replace the content (use Control+A and Control+V).  
Save changes to the file using the Commit changes button.  

## Embed Snyk in CI/CD pipeline
Since Snyk is a paid tool, you would also need to add the SNYK_TOKEN to the CI/CD variables on Gitlab CI.

Letâ€™s login into the GitLab and configure this token https://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/-/settings/ci_cd

Click on the Expand button under the Variables section, then click on the Add Variable button.

Add the following key/value pair in the form.

|Name|Value|
|:----|:----|
|Key|SNYK_TOKEN|
|Value|	INSERT_SNYK_TOKEN_HERE, you can find the token in your Snyk account at https://app.snyk.io/account|
Finally, Click on the button Add Variable

Next, visit https://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml

Click on the edit button and append the following code to the .gitlab-ci.yml file.
```

  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

  stage: test
  image: node:latest
  before_script:
    - wget -O snyk https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases/download/v1.388.0/snyk-linux
    - chmod +x snyk
    - mv snyk /usr/local/bin/
  script:
    - npm install
    - snyk test --json > snyk-results.json
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - snyk-results.json
    when: always
    expire_in: one week

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
Any change to the repo kickstarts the pipeline.
See the results of this pipeline by visiting https://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/pipelines.
Click on the appropriate job name to see the output.

## Allow the job failure
```
oast-snyk:
  stage: test
  image: node:latest
  before_script:
    - wget -O snyk https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases/download/v1.566.0/snyk-linux
    - chmod +x snyk
    - mv snyk /usr/local/bin/

    - npm install
    - snyk test --json > snyk-results.json
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - snyk-results.json
  allow_failure: true #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
```
