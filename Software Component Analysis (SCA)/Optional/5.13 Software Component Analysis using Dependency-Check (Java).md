# Software Component Analysis using Dependency-Check
Will learn how to install OWASP Dependency Check and run OAST Scans on a Java code.
Download the code, install the OAST tool, and then finally run the OAST scan on the code.

## Download the source code
Need to download the source code of the project from the git repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat.git webapp
```
## Install OWASP Dependency Check Tool
Dependency-Check is SCA tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a projectâ€™s dependencies.
https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck
Before installing Dependency-Check, we need to ensure if java is installed on our system
```sh
java -h
```
It seems Java is not installed, so we need to install Java. Letâ€™s update apt first.
```sh
apt update
```
Install Java
```sh
apt install openjdk-8-jre -y
```
Download Dependency Check source code
```sh
wget -O /opt/v6.1.6.zip https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/download/v6.1.6/dependency-check-6.1.6-release.zip
```
Extract the source code
```sh
unzip /opt/v6.1.6.zip -d /opt/
```
Add the tool to the PATH, so we can refer to it on the command line
```sh
export PATH=/opt/dependency-check/bin:$PATH
```
Explore the options that the tool provides
```sh
dependency-check.sh -h
**Output**
usage: Dependency-Check Core [--advancedHelp] [--enableExperimental]
       [--exclude <pattern>] [-f <format>] [--failOnCVSS <score>] [-h]
       [--junitFailOnCVSS <score>] [-l <file>] [-n] [-o <path>]
       [--prettyPrint] [--project <name>] [-s <path>] [--suppression
       <file>] [-v]

Dependency-Check Core can be used to identify if there are any known CVE
vulnerabilities in libraries utilized by an application. Dependency-Check
Core will automatically update required data from the Internet, such as
the CVE and CPE data files from nvd.nist.gov.

    --advancedHelp              Print the advanced help message.
    --enableExperimental        Enables the experimental analyzers.
    --exclude <pattern>         Specify an exclusion pattern. This option
                                can be specified multiple times and it
                                accepts Ant style exclusions.
 -f,--format <format>           The report format (HTML, XML, CSV, JSON,
                                JUNIT, SARIF, or ALL). The default is
                                HTML. Multiple format parameters can be
                                specified.
    --failOnCVSS <score>        Specifies if the build should be failed if
                                a CVSS score above a specified level is
                                identified. The default is 11; since the
                                CVSS scores are 0-10, by default the build
                                will never fail.
 -h,--help                      Print this message.
    --junitFailOnCVSS <score>   Specifies the CVSS score that is
                                considered a failure when generating the
                                junit report. The default is 0.
 -l,--log <file>                The file path to write verbose logging
                                information.
 -n,--noupdate                  Disables the automatic updating of the CPE
                                data.
 -o,--out <path>                The folder to write reports to. This
                                defaults to the current directory. It is
                                possible to set this to a specific file
                                name if the format argument is not set to
                                ALL.
    --prettyPrint               When specified the JSON and XML report
                                formats will be pretty printed.
    --project <name>            The name of the project being scanned.
 -s,--scan <path>               The path to scan - this option can be
                                specified multiple times. Ant style paths
                                are supported (e.g. 'path/**/*.jar'); if
                                using Ant style paths it is highly
                                recommended to quote the argument value.
    --suppression <file>        The file path to the suppression XML file.
                                This can be specified more then once to
                                utilize multiple suppression files
 -v,--version                   Print the version information.
```
## Run the OAST Scan
Perform the scan on the webgoat source code directory using the following command
```sh
dependency-check.sh --scan /webapp --format "CSV" --project "Webgoat" --failOnCVSS 8 --out /opt
```
> Notice the format, project name and output directory
At first, Dependency-Check will update its databases before scanning the code
```sh
