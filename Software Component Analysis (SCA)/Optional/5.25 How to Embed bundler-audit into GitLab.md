# A Simple CI/CD pipeline
Letâ€™s download the code using git clone in DevSecOps Box.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/rails.git rails
cd rails
```
Rename git url to the new one.
```sh
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/rails.git
```
Then, push the code into the repository.
```sh
git push -u origin --all
```
Enter GitLab credentials
```sh
Username for 'http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training': root
Password for 'http://root@gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training': pdso-training
```
Create pipeline with following contents:
```sh
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod


```
## Embed bundler-audit in CI/CD pipeline
Embed the bundler-audit tool in our CI/CD pipeline. However, do remember you need to run the command manually before you embed OAST in the pipeline.

Maybe you want to scan the components before performing SAST scans.
```sh 
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod



bundler-audit:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src hysnsec/bundle-audit check --format json --output bundle-audit-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [bundle-audit-output.json]
    when: always 
    expire_in: one week
```
Copy the above CI script and add it to the .gitlab.ci.yml file on Gitlab repo at https://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/rails/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml.

Did you notice the job failed because of non zero exit code(exit code 1)?

Why did the job fail? Because the tool found security issues. This is the expected behavior of any DevSecOps friendly tool.

You need to either fix the security issues or add allow_failure: true to let the job finish without blocking other jobs.

Please refer to the Linux Exit Code exercise in Linux Basics chapter.

You will notice that the bundler-audit job stores the output to a file bundle-audit-output.json.
## Allow the job failure
```sh
image: docker:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod


bundler-audit:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src hysnsec/bundler-audit ossi -q -j | tee bundler-audit-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [bundler-audit-output.json]
    when: always # What is this for?
    expire_in: one week
  allow_failure: true  
```
