The docker pull command serves for downloading Docker images from a registry. By default, the docker pull command pulls images from Docker Hub, but it is also possible to manually specify the private registry to pull from.
- **docker run**

When you use the basic run command, Docker automatically generates a container name with a string of randomly selected numbers and letters. Since there is a slim chance you will be able to remember or recognize the containers by these generic names, consider setting the container name to something more memorable.
