- **docker run**

When you use the basic run command, Docker automatically generates a container name with a string of randomly selected numbers and letters. Since there is a slim chance you will be able to remember or recognize the containers by these generic names, consider setting the container name to something more memorable.

- **apt install**

Install deb packages on Ubuntu, Debian, and related Linux distributions.
- **npm install**

This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on. If the package has a package-lock or shrinkwrap file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, with an npm-shrinkwrap.json taking precedence if both files exist.
