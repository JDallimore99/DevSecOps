# How to Embed Safety in GitLab

## Challenge
**Embed OAST scanning in the test stage using the safety tool. Make sure you are using hysnsec/safety docker image for this task. Understand the use of Docker’s -v (volume mount) flag/option. Ensure you follow the DevSecOps Gospel and best practices while embedding the safety tool.**
```
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    # We are going to pull the hysnsec/safety image to run the safety scanner
    - docker pull hysnsec/safety
    # third party components are stored in requirements.txt for python, so we will scan this particular file with safety.
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src hysnsec/safety check -r requirements.txt --json > oast-results.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [oast-results.json]
    when: always # What does this do?
  allow_failure: true
```
**Rename test job name to oast.**
```
oast:
  stage: test
  script:
    # We are going to pull the hysnsec/safety image to run the safety scanner
    - docker pull hysnsec/safety
    # third party components are stored in requirements.txt for python, so we will scan this particular file with safety.
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src hysnsec/safety check -r requirements.txt --json > oast-results.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [oast-results.json]
    when: always # What does this do?
  allow_failure: true
```

## Embed safety in CI/CD pipeline
As discussed in the SCA using the Safety exercise, we can embed the Safety tool in our CI/CD pipeline. However, do remember you need to run the command manually before you embed OAST in the pipeline.
Most of the code (up to 95%) in any software project is open-source/third-party components. It makes sense to perform SCA scans before static analysis.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image
services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

oast:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/safety  # We are going to pull the hysnsec/safety image to run the safety scanner
    # third party components are stored in requirements.txt for python, so we will scan this particular file with safety.
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src hysnsec/safety check -r requirements.txt --json > oast-results.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [oast-results.json]
    when: always # What does this do?

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step."
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
> Remember: Did you notice the job failed because of non zero exit code(here, exit code 255)?
Why did the job fail? Because the tool found security issues. This is the expected behavior of any DevSecOps friendly tool.
You need to either fix the security issues or add allow_failure: true to let the job finish without blocking other jobs.
Please refer to the Linux Exit Code exercise in Linux Basics chapter.

You will notice that the oast job stores the output to a file oast-results.json. We need the output file to process the results further either via APIs or vulnerability management systems like DefectDojo.

## Allow the Job failure
You do not want to fail the builds in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2. If a security tool fails a build upon security findings, you would want to allow it to fail and not block the pipeline as there would be false positives in the results.
You can use the allow_failure tag to “not fail the build” even though the tool found issues.
```
oast:
  stage: test
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/safety
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src hysnsec/safety check -r requirements.txt --json > oast-results.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [oast-results.json]
    when: always        # What does this do?
  allow_failure: true   # <--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
```
Go ahead and add it to the .gitlab-ci.yml file to run the pipeline.
You will notice that the oast job has failed but didn’t block the other jobs from running.
As discussed, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline.
