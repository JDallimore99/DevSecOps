# How to Embed Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) into GitLab

## A simple CI/CD pipeline
Considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager
```
We have two jobs in the above pipeline, the build job and the test job. As a security engineer, I do not care what they are doing as part of these jobs. Why? Imagine having to learn every build/testing tool used by your DevOps team. It will be a nightmare! Instead, rely on the DevOps team for help.

## Challenge
We will use the Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) to scan applications for security issues and then embed it into CI/CD using ZAP Baseline Scan docker image.
- Explore ZAP Baseline script/tool details here
- Use https://prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training as the endpoint for ZAP Scanning
- Remember to follow all best practices while adding the baseline scan to CI/CD pipeline

**Embed ZAP scanning in integration stage with job name as zap-baseline, please use owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.10.0 image to perform scans**
```
zap-baseline:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -w /zap -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk:rw --rm owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.10.0 zap-baseline.py -t https://prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training -J zap-output.json
```
**Save the result as JSON file with name zap-output.json and upload it using artifacts attribute**
```
zap-baseline:
  stage: integration
  before_script:
    - docker pull owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.10.0
  script:
    - docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -w /zap -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk:rw --rm owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.10.0 zap-baseline.py -t https://prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training -J zap-output.json
  after_script:
    - docker rmi owasp/zap2docker-stable:2.10.0  # clean up the image to save the disk space
  artifacts:
    paths: [zap-output.json]
    when: always        # What does this do?
  allow_failure: false  # Optional
```
## Embed ZAP in CI/CD Pipeline
As discussed in the Dynamic Analysis using ZAP exercises, we can put ZAP in our CI/CD pipeline. We did ensure the zap command runs fine in DevSecOps-Box, we need to embed this into CI/CD pipeline now using the same command.
```
