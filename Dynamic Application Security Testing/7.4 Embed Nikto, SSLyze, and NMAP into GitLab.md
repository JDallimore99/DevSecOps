# Embed Nikto, SSLyze, and NMAP into GitLab
Use Nikto, SSLyze, and Nmap to do DAST in CI/CD pipeline
## A simple CI/CD Pipeline
Imagine your boss asked you to embed DAST tools in a project’s CI pipeline. You have access to the source code, and you saw they were using the following .gitlab-ci.yml script.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager
```
You saw that the CI Script has two jobs, the build job and the test job. Assuming you do not understand python or any programming language, we can safely consider the DevOps team is building and testing the code.
## Embed DAST in CI/CD Pipeline
As discussed in the Dynamic Analysis exercises, we can integrate DAST tools like Nikto, SSLyze and Nmap in our CI/CD pipelines.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

nikto:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/nikto
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp hysnsec/nikto -h http://prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training -o /tmp/nikto-output.xml
  artifacts:
    paths: [nikto-output.xml]
    when: always

sslscan:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/sslyze
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp hysnsec/sslyze prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training:443 --json_out /tmp/sslyze-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [sslyze-output.json]
    when: always

nmap:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/nmap
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp hysnsec/nmap prod-6jnpiomi -oX /tmp/nmap-output.xml
  artifacts:
    paths: [nmap-output.xml]
    when: always

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
## Allow the job failure
You do not want to fail the builds in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2. If a security tool fails a job, it won’t allow other DevOps jobs like release/deploy to run hence causing great distress to DevOps Team. Moreover, the security tools suffer from false positives. Failing a build on inaccurate data is a sure recipe for disaster.
You can use the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found issues.
```
sslscan:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/sslyze
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp hysnsec/sslyze prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training:443 --json_out /tmp/sslyze-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [sslyze-output.json]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true   #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
```
Similarly, let’s append Nikto and nmap jobs as well.
After appending the above jobs to the pipeline, our pipeline would look like the following.
```
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env                       # Create a virtual environment for the python application
   - source env/bin/activate              # Activate the virtual environment
   - pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install the required third party packages as defined in requirements.txt
   - python manage.py check               # Run checks to ensure the application is working fine

test:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.6
  before_script:
   - pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
  script:
   - virtualenv env
   - source env/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - python manage.py test taskManager

nikto:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/nikto
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp hysnsec/nikto -h http://prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training -o /tmp/nikto-output.xml
  artifacts:
    paths: [nikto-output.xml]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true

sslscan:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/sslyze
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp hysnsec/sslyze prod-6jnpiomi.lab.practical-devsecops.training:443 --json_out /tmp/sslyze-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [sslyze-output.json]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true

nmap:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - docker pull hysnsec/nmap
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp hysnsec/nmap prod-6jnpiomi -oX /tmp/nmap-output.xml

    when: always
  allow_failure: true

prod:

    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
