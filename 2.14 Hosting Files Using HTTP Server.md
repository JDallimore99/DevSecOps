# Hosting Files Using HTTP Server
In this exercise, we will be creating a HTTP server using python to make the files easily accessible. This will be useful when you want to download or edit your file locally.
## HTTP Server
HTTP server is a web server which can be communicated using the **URLs** and **HTTP** protocol. It is widely used to create web applications and APIs.
Letâ€™s create a file **home_page.html** and host it using the python http server.
```sh
cat > home_page.html <<EOL
<html>
<body>
<p>Welcome to the home page!</p>
</body>
</html>
EOL
```
Now we have created the **file home_page.html.**
Creating the python server is simple, enter the below command:
```sh
python3 -m http.server &
**Output**
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
Open a new terminal and type below in the machine to find the devsecops machine name
```sh
hostname
**Output**
devsecops-box-gj1lt9xw
``` 
Now the files can be accessed using the below link.
https://devsecops-box-gj1lt9xw-8000.lab.practical-devsecops.training
Now you can click the **home_page.html** hyperlink and view the file.
You can save the file by clicking the secondary mouse button and choosing save as. Give respective file name with extension and press save.
