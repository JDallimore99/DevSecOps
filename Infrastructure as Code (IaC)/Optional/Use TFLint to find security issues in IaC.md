# Use TFLint to find security issues in IAC
Install TFLint
TFLint is a framework to find possible errors (like illegal instance types) for Major Cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP, warn about deprecated syntax, unused declarations and enforce best practices, naming conventions.

Install tflint on the system to perform static analysis on your IaC.
```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-linters/tflint/master/install_linux.sh | bash

## Run the TFLint tool
TFLint performs static analysis on our Terraform resources. In this scenario, we will try to scan aws directory to find any possible errors, and review if we are following best practices in Terraform resources.
```sh
tflint aws
```
```sh
**Output**
Failed to load configurations. 6 error(s) occurred:

Error: Invalid quoted type constraints

Warning: Quoted references are deprecated

In this context, references are expected literally rather than in quotes. Terraform 0.11 and earlier required quotes, but quoted references are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Terraform. Remove the quotes surrounding this reference to silence this warning.

```
As you can see, tflint found several errors that we need to fix in our Terraform configurations/code. Fixing errors when writing terraform resources will prevent errors occurring during runtime when executing with the terraform run command.
