# Secure IaC using Ansible Vault
Learn how to use Ansible to do secure IaC.
Learn how to use ansible-vault to encrypt your secrets when provisioning the infrastructure.

## Install Ansible and Ansible Vault
Ansible uses simple English like language to automate configurations, settings and deployments in traditional and cloud environments. Its easy to learn and can be understood by even non-technical folks.

Source: Ansible official website

We will do all the exercises locally first in DevSecOps-Box, so let’s start the exercise.

First, we need to install the ansible, ansible-vault is installed by default when you install ansible.
```sh
pip3 install ansible==6.4.0
```
## Create the inventory file
Let’s create the inventory or CMDB file for Ansible using the following command.
```sh
cat > inventory.ini <<EOL

# DevSecOps Studio Inventory
[devsecops]
devsecops-box-qxuaejri

[prod]
prod-qxuaejri

EOL
```
Next, we will have to ensure the SSH’s yes/no prompt is not shown while running the ansible commands so we will be using ssh-keyscan to capture the key signatures beforehand.
```sh
ssh-keyscan -t rsa prod-qxuaejri devsecops-box-qxuaejri >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
Let’s move to the next step.
## Run the ansible commands
Let’s run the ansible ad-hoc command to check the production machine’s uptime. We can use the uptime command to find the uptime.
```sh
ansible -i inventory.ini prod -m shell -a "uptime"
```
**Output**
```
prod-qxuaejri | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
 04:19:46 up 3 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.73, 0.49, 0.35
```
As you can see, we got the uptime of the production machine.
```
04:19:46 up 3 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.73, 0.49, 0.35
```
Similarly, we can use other ansible modules to install/remove a package, copy a file or any other task on the production machine.
For example, if we want to copy a file into the production machine.
```sh
echo "hello" > example
```
```sh
ansible -i inventory.ini prod -m copy -a "src=example dest=/example"
```
**Output**
```
prod-qxuaejri | CHANGED => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },

    "state": "file",
    "uid": 0
}
```
Let’s check the file is copied to the production machine.
```sh
ssh root@prod-qxuaejri
```
**Output**
```

As you can see, the file was successfully copied from DevSecOps Box to the production machine with the help of Ansible.

Let’s go back to the DevSecOps-Box machine to try out Ansible Vault functionality of Ansible.
```
exit
```
In the next step, you will learn how to send the file securely with ansible-vault.

## Encrypted Data with Ansible Vault
Ansible provides the ability to store secrets securely using Ansible Vault. Ansible can even send this file securely over the network using secure mechanisms like SSH and AES. For example, securely send a file containing a password over the network.
```sh
echo "StrongP@ssw0rd" > /secret
```
However, this file is not encrypted, and storing it in the source code is insecure, and hence not recommended. We can use ansible-vault command to encrypt the contents of the file before storing it into the code repository.
```sh
ansible-vault encrypt /secret --ask-vault-pass
```
You can use the following password as your password or anything you desire but ensure you remember this password as its needed when running ansible-playbook command.

|Name	|Value|
|:---|:----|
|Password|	C0mpl3xp@sswOrd|

```
New Vault password:
Confirm New Vault password:
Encryption successful
```
The above command encrypts the file using the AES algorithm, we can verify it by using the cat command.
```
cat /secret
```
**Output**
```
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
62663235633637356435616166313963366465653938333265633861613332666330613334653330

```
Note
Please ignore the Command Output, it should be different in your end.

No one but folks who know the ansible vault’s password can edit or view the file. Ansible provides an easy way to provide this password when the encrypted files need to be decrypted. This option/flag is called --ask-vault-pass.
```
ansible -i inventory.ini prod --ask-vault-pass -m copy -a "src=/secret dest=/secret"
```
**Output**
```
Vault password:
prod-qxuaejri | CHANGED => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": true,
    "checksum": "94b4760c3173f5622f2b1d28c3904acb2f9cf0b0",

    "state": "file",
    "uid": 0
}
```
Remember the decryption password for this file is C0mpl3xp@sswOrd.

Let’s SSH into our production machine.
```
ssh root@prod-qxuaejri "cat /secret"
```
**Output**
```
StrongP@ssw0rd
```
As you can see, the file was transferred to the remote machine after Ansible Vault decrypted the file.
