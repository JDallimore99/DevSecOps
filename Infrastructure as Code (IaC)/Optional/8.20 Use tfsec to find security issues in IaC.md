# Use tfsec to find security issues in IaC
Install the tool, download the code, run the scan on the code and evaluate your infrastructure’s security posture.
## Install tfsec
tfsec uses static analysis of your terraform templates to spot potential security issues.
https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec.
Install tfsec on the system to perform static analysis on your IaC.
```sh
wget -O /usr/local/bin/tfsec https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec/releases/download/v0.55.0/tfsec-linux-amd64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tfsec
```
Successfully installed tfsec.
## Download vulnerable infrastructure
Clone an example IaC (terraform) repository with the following command.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/terraform.git
```
Move into terraform directory.
```
cd terraform
```
Use -h to check the various options provided by this tool.
```sh
tfsec -h
```
```sh

  ## Run the tfsec tool
The tfsec perform the static scan on a directory. In this scenario, we will try to scan aws directory to find security issues.
```sh
tfsec aws
```
**OUTPUT**
```sh
...[SNIP]...
