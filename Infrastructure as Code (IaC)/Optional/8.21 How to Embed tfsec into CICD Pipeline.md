# How to Embed tfsec into CI/CD pipeline
## A simple CI/CD pipeline
Download the code using git clone in DevSecOps Box.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/terraform.git terraform
cd terraform
```
Rename git url to the new one.
```sh
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin http://gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/terraform.git
```
Then, push the code into the repository.
```sh
git push -u origin --all
```
And enter the GitLab credentials.
```sh
Username for 'http://gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training': root
Password for 'http://root@gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training': pdso-training
```
Considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is a build step"

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
Have four jobs in this pipeline, a build job, a test job, a integration job, and a prod job.  
Login into the GitLab using the following details and execute this pipeline.
https://gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/terraform/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml

Next, need to create a CI/CD pipeline by replacing the .gitlab-ci.yml file content with the above CI script. Click on the Edit button to replace the content (use Control+A and Control+V).
Save changes to the file using the Commit changes button.
## Embed tfsec in CI/CD pipeline
As discussed in the Secure IaC using tfsec exercise, we can embed tfsec in our CI/CD pipeline. However, you need to test the command manually before you embed this SAST tool in the pipeline.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - validate
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

tfsec:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src aquasec/tfsec /src -f json | tee tfsec-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [tfsec-output.json]
    when: always

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
As discussed, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline.
Can see the results of this pipeline by visiting https://gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/terraform/pipelines.
Click on the appropriate job name to see the output.
Notice that the tfsec jobâ€™s output is saved in tfsec-output.json file.

## Allow the job failure
We do not want to fail the builds/jobs/scan in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2, as security tools spit a significant amount of false positives.
Usee the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found issues.
```sh
tfsec:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src aquasec/tfsec /src -f json | tee tfsec-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [tfsec-output.json]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true   #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such#
```
