# How to Embed Checkov into CI/CD pipeline
## Simple CI/CD Pipeline
Create a new projects by visiting https://gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training/projects/new#blank_project, give the project name terraform and click Create project button. Once done we need to push our source code into GitLab, letâ€™s download the code using git clone in DevSecOps Box.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/terraform.git terraform
cd terraform
```
Rename git url to the new one.
```sh
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin http://gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/terraform.git
```
Then, push the code into the repository.
```sh
git push -u origin --all
```
And enter the GitLab credentials.
```sh
Username for 'http://gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training': root
Password for 'http://root@gitlab-ce-hh3rj0pi.lab.practical-devsecops.training': pdso-training
```

Considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is a build step"

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
There are four jobs in this pipeline, a build job, a test job, a integration job, and a prod job.
Login into the GitLab using the following details and execute this pipeline.
> Note: When in the exam, make sure the gitlab is on the right branch. By commiting code to the master branch, changes can be made and a pipeline run. If changes are made in main branch, no pipeline will run and therefore won't work.

## Embed Checkov in CI/CD pipeline
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

checkov:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - docker pull bridgecrew/checkov
    - docker run --rm -w /src -v $(pwd):/src bridgecrew/checkov -d aws -o json | tee checkov-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [checkov-output.json]
    when: always

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```

## Allow Job Failure
Append allow_failure: true to the end of the Checkov job
```sh
checkov:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - docker pull bridgecrew/checkov
    - docker run --rm -w /src -v $(pwd):/src bridgecrew/checkov -d aws -o json | tee checkov-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [checkov-output.json]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true   #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
```
