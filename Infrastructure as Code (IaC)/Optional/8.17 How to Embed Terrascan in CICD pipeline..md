#How to Embed Terrascan into CI/CD pipeline
In this scenario, you will learn how to embed terrascan in CI/CD pipeline.
## A simple CI/CD pipeline
Create a new projects by visiting https://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/projects/new#blank_project, give the project name terraform and click Create project button. Once done we need to push our source code into GitLab, let’s download the code using git clone in DevSecOps Box.
```sh
git clone https://gitlab.practical-devsecops.training/pdso/terraform.git terraform
cd terraform
```
Rename git url to the new one.
```sh
git remote rename origin old-origin
git remote add origin http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/terraform.git
```
Then, push the code into the repository.
```sh
git push -u origin --all
```
And enter the GitLab credentials.
```sh
Username for 'http://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training': root
Password for 'http://root@gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training': pdso-training
```
Considering your DevOps team created a simple CI pipeline with the following contents.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This is a build step"

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
We do have four jobs in this pipeline, a build job, a test job, a integration job, and a prod job.
Create a CI/CD pipeline by replacing the .gitlab-ci.yml file content with the above CI script. Click on the Edit button to replace the content (use Control+A and Control+V).
Save changes to the file using the Commit changes button.
## Embed terrascan in CI/CD pipeline
Embed terrascan in our CI/CD pipeline. However, you need to test the command manually before you embed this SAST tool in the pipeline.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - validate
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

terrascan:
  stage: validate
  image:
    name: accurics/terrascan:latest
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
  script:
    - /go/bin/terrascan scan . -o json > terrascan-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [terrascan-output.json]
    when: always

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
## Allow the job failure
We do not want to fail the builds/jobs/scan in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2, as security tools spit a significant amount of false positives.

You can use the allow_failure tag to not fail the build even though the tool found issues.
```sh
image: docker:latest  # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a latest docker image

services:
  - docker:dind       # To run all jobs in this pipeline, use a docker image which contains a docker daemon running inside (dind - docker in docker). Reference: https://forum.gitlab.com/t/why-services-docker-dind-is-needed-while-already-having-image-docker/43534

stages:
  - validate
  - build
  - test
  - release
  - preprod
  - integration
  - prod

terrascan:
  stage: validate
  image:
    name: accurics/terrascan:latest
    entrypoint: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
  script:
    - /go/bin/terrascan scan . -o json > terrascan-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [terrascan-output.json]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"

integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step"
    - exit 1
  allow_failure: true # Even if the job fails, continue to the next stages

prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual # Continuous Delivery
```
The terrascan job failed however it didn’t block others from continuing further.
