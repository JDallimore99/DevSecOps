# Docker Compose
## Intro
This tool allows us to handle multiple containers using a single file called docker-compose.yml.
Before moving forward, we need to know what are the differences between Docker and Docker Compose.
Let’s take an example to understand the differences.
First, we will try to run a container using docker run command.
```
docker run -d --name ubuntu -i ubuntu:18.04
```
> Note: You don’t need to pull the image before running the container as the image will be automatically pulled by the Docker CLI.

Next, lets accomplish the above task, that is running a container using Docker Compose. Can we just change the docker command to docker-compose command to make it work? No, because Docker Compose expects a docker-compose.yml YAML file containing the above instructions in a pre-defined format.
```
cat >docker-compose.yml<<EOF
version: "3"

services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu:18.04
    container_name: ubuntu1
    stdin_open: true        # the same way like docker run -i
EOF
```
As you can see in the above docker-compose.yml file, we are creating a container called ubuntu using ubuntu:18.04 (line number 6) image while keeping the stdin open (line number 7).
Let’s try running the container using docker-compose with the following command.
```
docker-compose up -d
**Output**
[+] Running 2/2
 ⠿ Network _default   Created
 ⠿ Container ubuntu1  Started
 ```
 > Note: When using docker-compose command, you don’t need to explicitly pass a docker-compose.yml file, because by default docker-compose command will check if there is a docker-compose.yml file in the current working directory.
 
As you can notice in the above command output, the docker compose created a network during the provisioning.
Now, We’ve run both ubuntu containers using docker and docker-compose command, lets verify their behaviour using the docker ps command.
```
docker ps
**Output**
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND   CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
9feadef43a7a   ubuntu:18.04   "bash"    26 seconds ago   Up 25 seconds             ubuntu1
ef8d7444bd00   ubuntu:18.04   "bash"    2 minutes ago    Up 2 minutes              ubuntu
```
Did you notice the similarities? We created ubuntu containers using different approaches but we are seeing similar container behaviour.
> Remember 
In order to move to the next steps, let’s remember to clean up by using the following command.
```docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)```
The above command kills all containers.
You can also use
```docker-compose down```
which would bring down the services (read ‘services’ as ‘containers’, for now) defined in the docker-compose.yml in the current working directory.

Now, imagine you have to run 3 or more containers for an application/task in the same network. To achieve the desired result, you would have to run the docker run command multiple times. It’s neither easy nor efficient.
Docker provides a better alternative called docker compose. You would define your desired container behavior in the docker-compose.yml file and use docker compose to provision them.
In the next step, you will learn more about Docker Compose.

## Compose file
When you want to run/handle multiple containers, you would need to use docker-compose command and its YAML file instead of the docker command. As we have learned in the previous step, we just have to convert docker run command into a YAML file. This YAML file will then be used by Docker Compose to manage the containers as per the instruction in the file.
Let’s explore the basic syntax used in the docker-compose.yml file
|Syntax|Description|
|:-----|:----------|
|version|Version of compose file format to use, check out this link|
|image|Specify the image to run|
|container_name|Specify a custom container name, rather than a default name|
|ports|Expose port(s), similar to docker run -p argument|
|environment|Add environment variables into the container by defining a key-value pair|
|volumes|Volumes to save our data persistently using various options type like bind or volumes|
We have definitely used the above features (instructions) in our previous docker exercises via docker run arguments. However, using a docker-compose file is more efficient as we are declaring the desired behaviour using a file (IaC - Infrastructure as Code).
The container behaviour is definied inside the services: dictionary, without it you won’t be able to operate docker containers using docker-compose command such as run, stop, exec etc.
Now, let us create docker-compose.yml file in a different directory
```
cat >~/docker-compose.yml<<EOF
version: "3"
services:
  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu:18.04
    container_name: myubuntu
    volumes:
     - data:/opt
  alpine:
    image: alpine:3.13
    container_name: myalpine
    volumes:
     - data:/tmp
volumes:
  data:
EOF
```
Lets run the following commands to navigate to the ~ (home) directory, and use docker-compose to bring up our services.
```
cd ~/
docker-compose up -d
**Output**
[+] Running 4/4
 ⠿ Network root_default  Created
 ⠿ Volume "root_data"    Created
 ⠿ Container ubuntu      Started
 ⠿ Container alpine      Started  
```
Check the containers process.
```
docker-compose ps
**Output**
NAME                COMMAND             SERVICE             STATUS              PORTS
alpine              "/bin/sh"           alpine              exited (0)          
ubuntu              "bash"              ubuntu              exited (0)
```
Why these two containers have stopped (exited (0))? Because there is no main process running inside the container, we can make the containers running by adding a process like shell or sleep command.
For now, let’s bring down all the services so we can move to the challenge in the next step.
```
docker-compose down
**Output**
[+] Running 3/3
 ⠿ Container ubuntu      Removed
 ⠿ Container alpine      Removed
 ⠿ Network root_default  Removed
```

## Challenge
**Create a compose file at /opt/docker-compose.yml with service name webserver using nginx image, binding port 80 from container to 8080 in the host and make sure the containers is running (not exited)**
```
cat > /opt/docker-compose.yml<<EOF
version: "3"
services:
  webserver:
    image: nginx
    container_name: webserver
    ports:
     - 8080:80
EOF
```
**Add docker volume name data into webserver service and mapping it to /usr/share/nginx/html**
```cat > /opt/docker-compose.yml<<EOF
version: "3"
services:
  webserver:
    image: nginx
    container_name: webserver
    ports:
     - 8080:80
    volumes:
     - data:/usr/share/nginx/html

volumes:
  data:
EOF
```
**Create a random file with hello world text inside the webserver container and save it in /usr/share/nginx/html/hello.html**
Before starting to create a file inside the container, we will need to start the container first.
The docker-compose.yml file is located at the /opt directory. So we can either cd in to the /opt directory, and then run docker-compose up -d or use the below command to run docker-compose with a docker-compose.yml file in another location.
```
docker-compose -f /opt/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
After the services are up, you can create a file inside the container container using docker exec or docker-compose exec.
```
docker exec webserver sh -c 'echo "hello world" > /usr/share/nginx/html/hello.html'
```
