### Search in multiple occurences
Now we know how to search for a particular word in the text file using vi editor, How do we move from one word to another word when there is multiple occurences?
We can move or search for the next or previous occurence in the text file using the n. We use n for search for the next occurence and **shift + n** for going back to the previous occurence.
Open the file **security-report.json**, search for the text **High**
Now press n to move the next occurence and press **shift + n** for the previous occurence.
