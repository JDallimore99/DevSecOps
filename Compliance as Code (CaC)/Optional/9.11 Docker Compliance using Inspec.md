# Docker Compliance using Inspec
Learn how to implement CIS Docker Benchmark checks as an Inspec profile.
## Install Inspec Tool
Chef InSpec is an open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and infrastructure. Chef InSpec works by comparing the actual state of your system with the desired state that you express in easy-to-read and easy-to-write Chef InSpec code. Chef InSpec detects violations and displays findings in the form of a report, but puts you in control of remediation.

Download the Inspec Debian package from the InSpec website.
```sh
wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/inspec/4.18.114/ubuntu/16.04/inspec_4.18.114-1_amd64.deb
```
Install the downloaded package
```sh
dpkg -i inspec_4.18.114-1_amd64.deb

```
## Run the Inspec profile
In addition to scanning a host, we can also use Inspec to inspect a running container or the Docker Daemon itself. We can define compliance controls in our organization and avoid running containers that do not satisfy the organization’s compliance baselines.
Check whether our servers follow the CIS Docker Benchmark best practices using the Dev-Sec’s cis-docker-benchmark Inspec profile.
Run the profile against the DevSecOps Box(local machine).
```sh
inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-docker-benchmark --chef-license accept
**Output**

Test Summary: 79 successful, 80 failures, 36 skipped
```
You can see, the output does inform us about 15 successful controls and 25 control failures.
The above profile not only helps us in scanning for daemon related misconfigurations but also running containers. Run a docker container and see this functionality in action!
```sh
docker run -d --name alpine -it alpine /bin/sh
```
We can see all the running containers on a machine using the docker ps command.
```sh
docker ps
**Output**

Now run the linux-baseline profile against this container.

Profile Summary: 15 successful controls, 2 control failures, 39 controls skipped
Test Summary: 39 successful, 8 failures, 40 skipped
Now that we have a container running, what would happen if we run the cis-docker-benchmark profile again on this machine?
```
```sh
inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-docker-benchmark --chef-license accept
**Output**
...[SNIP]...

Profile Summary: 29 successful controls, 36 control failures, 35 controls skipped
Test Summary: 100 successful, 94 failures, 36 skipped
The output changes from 15 successful controls to 29 and 25 control failures to 36.
```
This change is because of skipped container runtime checks as no containers were running when we first used this inspec profile. After we started a container, Inspec also included runtime checks as part of the scan.

We can verify this behaviour by visiting https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-docker-benchmark and selecting the container_runtime.rb under the controls directory.
