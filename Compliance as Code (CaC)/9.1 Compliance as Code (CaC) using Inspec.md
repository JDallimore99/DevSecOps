# Compliance as Code (CaC) using Inspec
Learn how to achieve compliance automation using the Inspec tool
## Install InSpec
Chef InSpec is an open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and infrastructure. Chef InSpec works by comparing the actual state of your system with the desired state that you express in easy-to-read and easy-to-write Chef InSpec code. Chef InSpec detects violations and displays findings in the form of a report, but puts you in control of remediation.
https://www.inspec.io/docs

Let’s install the Inspec on the system to learn Compliance as Code (CaC).
Download the Inspec debian package from the InSpec website.
```sh
wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/inspec/4.37.8/ubuntu/18.04/inspec_4.37.8-1_amd64.deb
```
Install the downloaded package 
```sh
dpkg -i inspec_4.37.8-1_amd64.deb
```
We have successfully installed the Inspec tool, let’s explore the functionality it provides us.
```sh
inspec --help

## Run the Inspec Profile
Let’s try to check whether our servers follow the linux-baseline best practices. We will be using the Dev-Sec’s linux-baseline Inspec profile.
Before executing the profile, we need to run the below command:
```sh
echo "StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new" >> ~/.ssh/config
```
This command prevents the ssh agent from prompting YES or NO question.
Let’s run the Inspec against the production server.
- The first parameter tells the Inspec profile that we need to run against the server
- -t tells the target machine
- -i flag used to specify the ssh-key since we are using login in via ssh
- --chef-license accept tells that we are accepting license this commands prevent the inspec from prompting YES or NO question

```sh
inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline -t ssh://root@prod-acsrq8h9 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa --chef-license accept
```
**Output**
```

## Challenge - Embed Inspec in the CI/CD Pipeline
This exercise is to do continuous compliance scanning for production server (prod-acsrq8h9). We will be embedding a dedicated Compliance as Code tool called Inspec in CI/CD pipeline.
Doing so will provide immediate feedback to the DevOps teams of any deviation from standard policies.
You can use the following URL and credentials to log into GitLab CI/CD.
**Use hysnsec/inspec docker image to perform continuous compliance scanning with https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline profile and embed it as part of the prod stage with job name as inspec**
```sh
inspec:
  stage: prod
  before_script:
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    - echo "$DEPLOYMENT_SERVER_SSH_PRIVKEY" | tr -d '\r' > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    - ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - ssh-keyscan -t rsa $DEPLOYMENT_SERVER >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v $(pwd):/share hysnsec/inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline -t ssh://root@$DEPLOYMENT_SERVER -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa --chef-license accept
```
**The job should only be triggered when changes are pushed to the master branch (don’t use rules attribute)**
```sh
inspec:
  stage: prod
  only:
    - master
  before_script:
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    - echo "$DEPLOYMENT_SERVER_SSH_PRIVKEY" | tr -d '\r' > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    - ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - ssh-keyscan -t rsa $DEPLOYMENT_SERVER >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v $(pwd):/share hysnsec/inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline -t ssh://root@$DEPLOYMENT_SERVER -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa --chef-license accept
```
**Save the output as JSON file at /share/inspec-output.json and upload it using artifacts attribute**
```sh
inspec:
  stage: prod
  only:
    - master
  environment: production
  before_script:
    - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    - echo "$DEPLOYMENT_SERVER_SSH_PRIVKEY" | tr -d '\r' > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    - ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    - ssh-keyscan -t rsa $DEPLOYMENT_SERVER >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -v $(pwd):/share hysnsec/inspec exec https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline -t ssh://root@$DEPLOYMENT_SERVER -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa --chef-license accept --reporter json:/share/inspec-output.json
  artifacts:
    paths: [inspec-output.json]
    when: always
```

## Embed Inspec in CI/CD pipeline
Let’s login into the GitLab and configure production machine https://gitlab-ce-acsrq8h9.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/-/settings/ci_cd.
We can use the GitLab credentials provided below to login i.e.,
Click the Expand button under the Variables section, then click on the Add Variable button.
Add the following key/value pair in the form.
|Name|Value|
|:---|:---|
|Key|DEPLOYMENT_SERVER|
|Value|prod-acsrq8h9|

|Name|Value|
|:---|:---|
|Key|DEPLOYMENT_SERVER_SSH_PRIVKEY|
|Value|Copy the private key from the production machine using SSH. The SSH key is available at /root/.ssh/id_rsa. Please refer to Advanced Linux Exercises for a refresher on SSH Keys|
```sh
ssh prod-acsrq8h9
cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa

> Remember: Did you notice the job failed because of exit code 100. Why did the job fail? The inspec tool found several control failures and you need to fix them or add allow_failure: true to pass the job and move to next job. Please refer the Linux Exit Code exercise in Linux Basics chapter.
