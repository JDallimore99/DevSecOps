# Continuous Integration using Jenkins
In this scenario, you will learn how to configure Jenkins as a CI/CD system with GitLab. We will also create a simple CI/CD pipeline via the Jenkinsfile for a sample project.
## Create a new job
The Jenkins system is already configured with GitLab. If you wish to know how to configure Jenkins with GitLab, you can check out this link.

We will create a new job in Jenkins by visiting https://jenkins-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/newJob.

You can use the following details to log into Jenkins.
- Username:	root
- Password: pdso-training

Provide a name for your new item, e.g., django.nv, select the Pipeline option, and click on the OK button.

In the next screen, do the following steps:

1. Click on the Build Triggers tab, check the Build when a change is pushed to GitLab..... checkbox.
2. At the bottom right-hand side, choose the Advanced… button below the Comment (regex) for triggering a build form field.
3. Click on the Generate button under Secret token to generate a token.
We will use this token for GitLab’s Webhook Settings. This webhook setting will allow GitLab to let Jenkins know whenever a change is made to the repository.


Please visit the following GitLab URL to set up the Jenkins webhook.
- URL	https://gitlab-ce-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/hooks
- 
Fill the form using the following details.
- URL:	https://jenkins-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/project/django.nv
- Secret Token:	Paste the secret token we just generated above.
Click on the Add webhook button, and go back to the Jenkins tab to continue the setup process.

Click on the Pipeline tab, and select Pipeline script from SCM from Definition options. Once you do that, few more options would be made available to you.

Select Git as SCM, enter our django.nv repository http url.
- Repository URL	http://gitlab-ce-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv.git
- 
Since we haven’t added the GitLab credentials to the Jenkins system, you will get an error.
```
Failed to connect to repository : Command "git ls-remote -h -- http://gitlab-ce-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv HEAD" returned status code 128:
stdout:
stderr: remote: HTTP Basic: Access denied
fatal: Authentication failed for 'http://gitlab-ce-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv.git/'
```
Let’s add the credentials by clicking on the Add button (the one with a key symbol). Select the Jenkins option and fill the pop-up form with the following details.
- Username:	root
- Password:	pdso-training
- ID:	gitlab-auth
- Description:	Leave it blank as it’s optional

Click on the Add button, and select our new credentials from the Credentials Dropdown.

The error we experienced before should be gone by now.

Finally, click the Save button.

## Verify the pipeline run
Since we want to use Jenkins to execute the CI/CD jobs, there is no need for the .gitlab-ci.yml file. Instead we will be using a Jenkinsfile to configure the Jenkins pipeline. In the following steps, we will be renaming .gitlab-ci.yml to .gitlab-ci.yml.backup from the git repository. Doing so will prevent GitLab from running the CI jobs on both the GitLab Runner and the Jenkins systems.
Don’t forget to disable Auto DevOps in GitLab as it will execute the job when any changes are pushed to the repository even though the .gitlab-ci.yaml file is missing.
Visit http://gitlab-ce-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv/-/settings/ci_cd to disable it.
#### Initial git setup
To work with git repositories via Command Line Interface (CLI), aka terminal/command prompt, we need to set up a username and an email. We can use git config commands to set these two settings.
```
git config --global user.email "student@pdevsecops.com"

git config --global user.name "student"
```
#### Clone the repository
Let’s clone our code in DevSecOps Box.
```
git clone http://root:pdso-training@gitlab-ce-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/root/django-nv.git
```
Did you notice the username/password combination before the @ symbol?

By cloning the above repository, we created a local copy of the remote repository.

Let’s cd into this repository to explore its content.
```
cd django-nv
```
#### Add a file to the repository
Rename .gitlab-ci.yml to .gitlab-ci.yml.backup so you can change it back when you want to use GitLab Runner again.
```
git mv .gitlab-ci.yml .gitlab-ci.yml.backup
```
Next, we will create the Jenkinsfile. This file is similar to the .gitlab-ci.yml file but for the Jenkins system.
```
cat > Jenkinsfile <<EOL

    agent any

    options {
        gitLabConnection('gitlab')
    }

    stages {
        stage("build") {

                    args '-u root'
                }
            }

            }
        }
        stage("test") {
            agent { 
                docker {

                    args '-u root'
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh """

                """
            }
        }
        stage("integration") {
            steps {
                catchError(buildResult: 'SUCCESS', stageResult: 'UNSTABLE') {
                    echo "This is an integration step"
                    sh "exit 1"
                }
            }
        }
        stage("prod") {
            steps {
                input "Deploy to production?"
                echo "This is a deploy step"
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        failure {
            updateGitlabCommitStatus(name: "\${env.STAGE_NAME}", state: 'failed')
        }
        unstable {
            updateGitlabCommitStatus(name: "\${env.STAGE_NAME}", state: 'failed')
        }
        success {
            updateGitlabCommitStatus(name: "\${env.STAGE_NAME}", state: 'success')
        }
        aborted {
            updateGitlabCommitStatus(name: "\${env.STAGE_NAME}", state: 'canceled')
        }
        always { 
            deleteDir()                     // clean up workspace
        }
    }
}
EOL
```
Let’s add this file to the repository and commit the changes.
```
git add Jenkinsfile
git commit -m "Create the .gitlab-ci.yml backup and add Jenkinsfile"
```
#### Push the changes to the remote repository
Since git is a decentralized source code management system, all changes are made in your local git repository. You have to push these changes to the server for it to reflect on the git server.
We have internet connectivity, let’s push it to the remote git repository using the git push command.
```
git push origin master
```

As discussed earlier, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline.

We can see the result of this change in Jenkins at https://jenkins-0qiafpel.lab.practical-devsecops.training/job/django.nv.
