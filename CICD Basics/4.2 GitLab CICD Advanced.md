# GitLab CI/CD Advanced
## Fail a build using exit code
As discussed in the Linux basics exercises, a process shares its pass/fail status via exit codes. The CI/CD systems also behave similarly and use exit codes to either pass or fail a job/stage.
```
stages:   # Dictionary
 - build   # this is build stage
 - test    # this is test stage
 - integration # this is an integration stage
 - prod       # this is prod/production stage
build:       # this is job named build, it can be anything, job1, job2, etc.,
  stage: build    # this job belongs to the build stage. Here both job name and stage name is the same i.e., build
  script:
    - echo "This is a build step"  # We are running an echo command, but it can be any command.
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step"
    # ************ Non zero exit code, fails a job. ************ #
    - exit 1
integration:        # integration job under stage integration.
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step."
prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
```
You will notice that test has **exit 1**. When you add/edit this job in Gitlab, it will fail the build because of exit 1. CI/CD systems look for exit codes to determine if a job passed or failed.
For example, you ran a security tool on your codebase, and it found some security issues, then the security tool might give a non zero exit code. Non zero exit code fails a job (red color), but if the tool gives you a zero exit code (green color) CI/CD system will mark it as passed.
As discussed, any change to the repo kick starts the pipeline.

## Allow the job failure
You do not want to fail the builds in DevSecOps Maturity Levels 1 and 2. If a security tool fails a build upon security findings, you would not want this job to block the other jobs and stages as there could be false positives in the results.
You can use the allow_failure tag to “not fail the build” even though the tool found issues.
```
test:
  stage: test
  script:
     - execute_script_that_will_fail
  allow_failure: true   #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
```
You will notice that test job has exit 1. If you add the above script to the GitLab, it will fail the build because of the exit 1 command. The CI/CD systems look for exit codes to determine if a job passed or failed.
You will notice that we now have an exclamation (!) mark instead of a green or red mark.
(!) means passed with warnings
## Save scan results
To manage found vulnerabilities during the scan, we would like to store the scan results in a file and save it on the CI system for further processing.
You can store the tool result(s) in a file using the **artifacts** tag as shown below.
```
someScan:
  script: ./security-tool.sh    # <-- this tool generates vulnerabilities.json as output
  artifacts:                    # <--- To save results, we use artifacts tag
    paths:                      # <--- We then give the path/paths of the scan result files we want to store for further processing
    - vulnerabilities.json                  #<--- The filename
    expire_in: 1 week       # <--- To save disk space, we want to store only for 1 week
```
As you can see above, we need to specify the output file’s path on line numbers 4 and 5 and the expiration(line number 6) under the artifacts tag.
To keep our pipeline simple for everyone, we will echo the JSON string into a file for now instead of running a security tool.
```
stages:   # Dictionary
 - build   # this is build stage
 - test    # this is test stage
 - integration # this is an integration stage
 - prod       # this is prod/production stage
build:       # this is job named build, it can be anything, job1, job2, etc.,
  stage: build    # this job belongs to the build stage. Here both job name and stage name is the same i.e., build
  script:
    - echo "This is a build step"  # We are running an echo command, but it can be any command.
    - echo "{\"vulnerability\":\"SQL Injection\"}" > output.json
  artifacts:      # notice a new tag artifacts
    paths: [output.json]   # this is the path to the output.json file
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This is a test step."
    - exit 1         # Non zero exit code, fails a job.
  allow_failure: true   #<--- allow the build to fail but don't mark it as such
integration:        # integration job under stage integration.
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "This is an integration step."
prod:
  stage: prod
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
```
You will notice that build job generates the output.json, and if we do not specify expire_in tag, the output file will live on the CI System indefinitely.
When verifying you will find the output.json file under the artifacts section on your right-hand side.
## Implement Continous Delivery 
If you wish to have a human approval process before deployment, you can use the continuous delivery feature of Gitlab using the **when** tag.
As you can see below, using a **when: manual** tag, we can enforce a human intervention (click the play button in Gitlab) to run a job (deployment).
```
deploy_prod:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploy to prod server."
  when: manual   #<-- A human has to click a button (play button in Gitlab) for this task to execute.
 ```
 To keep our pipeline simple for everyone, instead of deploying an app, we will add when tag to the pipeline.
 You will notice that prod job has **when: manual** and it will enforce a human intervention, and a person has to approve the job before it runs.
 ## Challenge: Fail a job and allow it to fail
 **Create four stages, namely build, test, integration, and deploy***
 ```
 stages:   # Dictionary
 - build   # this is build stage
 - test    # this is test stage
 - integration # this is an integration stage
 - deploy       # this is deploy stage
 ```
 **Create a file using the echo “this is an output” > output.txt command in the integration stage and upload output.txt using the artifacts tag **
 ```
 integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "this is an output" > output.txt
  artifacts:
    paths: [output.txt]
    when: always
```
**Fail the integration job using exit 1**
```
integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "this is an output" > output.txt
    - exit 1
  artifacts:
    paths: [output.txt]
    when: always
```
**Allow the integration job to fail, yet move on to the next stage**
```
integration:
  stage: integration
  script:
    - echo "this is an output" > output.txt
    - exit 1
  artifacts:
    paths: [output.txt]
    when: always
  allow_failure: true
 ```
 **Create a job requiring a person’s approval (a button, play button) in order to run the job**
 ```
 deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This is a deploy step."
  when: manual
 ```
