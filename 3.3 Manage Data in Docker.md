# Manage Data in Docker
## Docker Volumes
Learn how to manage the data in Docker with various options like **Volumes**, **Bind mounts**, and **tmpfs**.
Understand these mechanisms with the **docker volume** command.
```sh
docker volume --help
**Output**
Usage: Docker volume COMMAND

Manage volumes

Commands:
  create      Create a volume
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more volumes
  ls          List volumes
  prune       Remove all unused local volumes
  rm          Remove one or more volumes

Run 'docker volume COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```
Create a new volume called **demo**.
```sh
docker volume create demo
docker volume ls
**Output**
DRIVER              VOLUME NAME
local               demo
```
Now you will see our volume is created. This demo volume is located under the **/var/lib/docker/volumes/** directory.
```sh
ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/
**Output**
demo  metadata.db
```
The above output shows that the docker volume command has created a new directory in our system.
How can we know if the container will save the data persistently even after we kill the container?
Let’s run a container with the following command and map the demo volume to the /opt directory inside the container.
```sh
docker run --name ubuntu -d -v demo:/opt -it ubuntu:18.04
**Output**
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:18.04' locally

```
Enter into the container's shell
```sh 
docker exec -it ubuntu bash 
**Output**
root@955ac8f485ea:/# 
```
Create a file and save it in the **/opt** directory.
```sh
root@955ac8f485ea:/# echo "Hello from the containers" > /opt/hello.txt
```
Created a file. Let’s exit from the shell then delete/remove the container.
```sh
exit
docker rm -f ubuntu
```
The file is not deleted. Why? Because the file is saved on the host system.
```sh
ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/demo/_data/
**Output**
hello.txt
```
If you create a file outside the **/opt** directory, it will be removed because we only mounted the volume to **/opt** directory.
We can also attach the existing volume to another container on a different path (e.g., **/tmp**).
```sh
docker run --name ubuntu1 -d -v demo:/tmp -it ubuntu:18.04
```
Look at **/tmp** directory in the container, and you will see hello.txt file there.
```sh
docker exec -it ubuntu1 ls /tmp
**Output**
hello.txt
```
hello.txt survives the container removal.

## Bind mounts
The second option is **bind mounts**. Unlike volumes, we do not need to run specific commands to create a bind mount. We can directly mount a host’s directory into a container’s directory.
```sh
docker run --name ubuntu2 -d -v /opt:/opt -it ubuntu:18.04
```
Enter into the ubuntu2 container's shell and list the file(s) in the container’s __/opt_ directory.
```sh
docker exec -it ubuntu2 bash
ls /opt
**Output**
containerd
```
Let’s explore the docker volumes directory for containerd directory’s presence.
```sh
ls /var/lib/docker/volumes
**Output**
demo metadata.mb
```
The output is still the same. It doesn’t give us information about **containerd** directory or volumes created by docker.
How about /opt directory on the host system?
```sh 
ls /opt
**Output**
containerd
```
The **containerd** directory is originating from **opt** directory. The reason is simple, we use **bind mounts**, and docker will map our host directory to the container’s specific directory. This mapping is defined while running the container using the **-v /opt:/opt** option.

Next, create a file on the host system under **/opt** directory called hello.txt.
```sh
echo "Hello from the host" > /opt/hello.txt
```
Remove the old containers with docker rm command
```sh
docker rm -f ubuntu2
```
Start a new container with the following command
```sh
docker run --name ubuntu2 -d -v /opt:/opt -it ubuntu:18.04
```
Then, you can use the docker exec command to get a shell into the container.
```sh
root@70c10b31c605:/# ls /opt
**Output**
containerd  hello.txt
```
As you can see, the hello.txt file, which we created in the host’s /opt directory, is successfully mapped inside the container’s /opt directory.
What would happen if we remove hello.txt from the container?
```
rm /opt/hello.txt
exit
ls /opt/hello.txt
**Output**
ls: cannot access '/opt/hello.txt': No such file or directory
```
The file we removed inside the container is no longer present on the host’s file system.
In conclusion, the host and container share the file system. When we add, change, or remove the file(s) inside a container, they are being added, altered, or removed from the host as well.

## tmpfs
This tmpfs mount will not save the data persistently as it uses host’s memory(RAM) as a temporary storage.

## Challenge 
**Create a hello.txt file under the /opt directory. The file can have some random text of your choice**
```sh
echo 'It is what it is' >> /opt/hello.txt
```
**Create a container with name bindmount using ubuntu:18.04 image. Mount the above file (not the directory) as a bind mount inside this container at /src location.**
We have explored volumes in this exercise and have used -v arguement.
Please feel free to re-visit the steps for a refresher.
e.g., docker run -v /opt:/tmp ubuntu
```sh
docker run --name bindmount -v /opt/hello.txt:/src/hello.txt ubuntu:18.04
```
>Note Notice in the above command, how we are specifically mounting the file /opt/hello.txt as a file of the same name hello.txt inside the /src location

**Create a new volume called data using docker volume command**
You can use docker volume command to create a volume.

For e.g., docker volume create myvolume
```sh
docker volume create data
```
**Run an another ubuntu:18.04 container with name volumemount. Mount the data volume we just created into the container at /src location. Create a file /src/hello.txt in this container with some random text**
Hint is above and my code is below. Both worked.
```sh 
docker run --name volumemount -v data:/src ubuntu:18.04 "/bin/bash" "-c" "echo test>>/src/hello.txt"
or 
docker run --name volumemount -d -v data:src/ -it ubuntu:18.04
docker exec -it volumemount bash
echo "It is what it is" > /src/hello.txt
```
